## Lab manager

* Biosafety levels are based on the agents or organisms being worked with
* Primary barriers: specialised safety equipment
* Secondary barriers: facility design
* Level 1
  * Open lab bench
  * Not isolated from buliding
  * Training given
  * Mechanical pipetting only (no "mouth pipetting")
  * Safe sharps handling
  * Decontaminate potentially infectious materials with autoclaving
  * PPE
* Level 2
  * Human disease
  * The next level of barriers (cabinets)
  * Self-closing lockable doors
  * No handling broken glass
* Level 3
  * Strictly controlled
  * All BSL 2
  * Stringent access control and decontamination of all wastes
  * Solid-front wraparound gowns, scrub suits, respirators
  * Self-closing double doors, separate from general building corridors
  * Ducted, directioanl airflow with no recirculation
* Level 4
  * Complete clothing change before entry
  * Shower on exit
  * Decontamination of all materials
  * Class III biological saftey cabinet
  * Separate building, or totally isolated zone
  * HEPA filters

## The Guardian

* 116 accidents in last 5 years (in the UK I guess?) at laboratories where the most dangerous organisms are handled
* 75 serious enough to investigate, many leading to enforcement
* "Does British agriculture have a death wish"
* Serious accidents: mistakes which chain one after the other
* Lab managers obliged by law to tell HSE (good!)
* Sending live anthrax
* More management, inadequate training, inappropriate procedures, equipment failures, human error, bad luck
* UK labs rated by their containment level (CL)
* Porton Down
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Vegetarian
* Pirbright managers pleaded guilty to eight breaches of safety legislation around foot and mouth experiments
* Punishment creates incentives not to report
* Learn from other disciplines?

## Bulletin

* 59 total BSL-4 labs
* Dual-use: 3 countries have polices on this
* Need to adopt international standards of biosecurity
* ISO standard
* Need to agree on a third party to oversee compliance
* Specialised skillset required -- might not be possible or financially viable for private company to provide this service
* Could use national regulators
  * But sometimes countries might disagree or there may be suspicion (e.g. Chinese officials insisting no accident or research at Wuhan BSL-4 led to COVID-19)
* International Experts Group of Biosafety and Biosecurity Regulators (IEGBBR)
* World Health Organisation (WHO) 
* Comment: move BSL-4 outside major metro areas
* Comment: WHO team sent to Wuhan denied entry and data

## CHS

2. Terms need to be defined clearly
3. Separate issue from other issues which may be conflated e.g. GMOs
4. NGOs will play an important role (like NTI)
5. Safety norms beyond individual lab workers
6. US security based assistance (may need rethinking?)
7. Biotech up, number of labs up, more pressing issue now
8. Stop people publishing in top journals unless they adhere to certain standards (underused lever)
9. Need incident data
10. More funding for biosafety research
11. Accident and incident reporting needs to be anonymous
12. Near miss needs to be defined
13. WHO and OECD could help advance norms
14. More formal process for developing emerging biosafety norms
