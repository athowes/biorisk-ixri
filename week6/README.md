# Esvelt video

* Transmissible vaccines
  * Esvelt not sure about anything that teaches us how to engineer $R_0$
* Nucleic Acid Observatory
* Would pick up DNA but not non-DNA
* Tree of life genomics project
* Plants replicate their genetic information just because
* $k$-mer repetition

# Biodefence

* Prevent attack, minimise effects of attack
* Overlapping tools which taken together provide greater value
* Norms and self-goverance
* NK flaunts nuclear program but denies BW
* Fink report
* Screen DNA orders
* Select agent
* Vaccines are a deterrent
* Healthy population and strong health system is a deterrent
* All around the world
* Capability to recognise and attribute an attack
* Harder to detect in poorer countries or warzones
* EMRs, search engines queries, data on pharam purchases
* List based screening and olignucleotide screening
* Can't screen for sequences which confer specific pathogen characteristics, just screen for "is it identical"
* Many individuals may not present with symptoms
* May be possible to develop bioweapons which alter the human host and are not immediately obvious
* Reference specimen to use as comparator
* Current techniques very reliant on the secrecy of the exact genome regions used for the PCR primers and probes
* Synthetic biology could effect environmental surveillance too
  * Unbiased detection is extremely challenging
* What constitutes a taxonomic unit
* "Normal" background microbial composition is poorly characterised for many environments and can be effected by many factors
* Approaches such as metagenomics and environmental surveillance unlikely to completely fulfill the need
* Screening of activities with ML
* Much of NA space yet to be sequenced or characterised -- hard to say if a given agent is natural or nonnatural
  * Can say if genes appear in weird places
  * Products of genetic circuit engineering are recognisable
* Lack of single US entity responsible
  * e.g. maybe pandemic department would be good
* They're working on controling genome editing activity, screening DNA synthesis orders, distinguishing between natural and man-made organisms, databases
* Analysis of strains
* "Next-generation" sequencing (what is this?)
  * 100k in 2001 for amerithrax
  * "ultra-deep" for 10k now
* Diagnostics
* "Sentinel bacteria"
* New vaccine strains, fast mRNA vaccines
