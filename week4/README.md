# Benefits & Risks of Biotechnology (FLI)

* Biotechnology potentially more risky than other research as
  * Small
  * Can spread
* GoF, gene drives, gene editing

# Biodefence

* Try designs in parallel
* Use biological knowledge in the design stage
* Use directed evolution
  * Directed evolution is a cyclic process that alternates between gene diversification and screening for or selection of functional gene variants
* "Cheaper to make than to think"
* Some things easier than others (e.g. increasing ethanol production)
* DBT cycle
* DNA synthesis and assembly
  * Moore's Law-like
* Genome engineering
  * Synthesise DNA quickly
* Improved computational modeling
  * Bayesian optimisation!
* Genetic logic circuits
* Directed evolution
  * Lots of information on fitness landscapes
  * Ferrets and influenza
* Specify-Design-Build-Test-Learn cycle
* Combinatorial approaches (cheaper to build than think)
* High throughput data acquisition
  * DBT cycle
  * Combinatorial assembly
  * CRISPR/Cas-based editing methods
  * Directed evolution
* Sharing via e.g. Synthetic Biology Open Language
  * More community knowledge
* Key thing is Figure 3.1.

# In person

* Knock out, knock in
* Failure rates were higher than with traditional methods
* Understand what certain genes do
* Try to understand what each gene does (mechanistic)
