## Emerging Infections

* Poorly equipped to respond to HIV/AIDS
* Strides have and continue to be made in battle against infectious disease
  * Penicillin
  * Vaccines
  * Genetic engineering: drugs, vaccines, therapeutic agents
* Pesticides against arthropod-borne disease
  * Arthropods are invertebrates with jointed legs. They make up about 75% of all animals on Earth
  * Overuse
* Eliminate sites where vectors breed and reproduce
  * The Greeks and Romans have even undertaken drainage projects to eliminate malaria!
* Cycles of response then neglect
* Sanitation and hygiene
  * Clean water
  * Personal hygiene
  * Handling food
* Quarantine
  * "Relied on more heavily than its practical value warranted"
  * "For the most part... did more harm than good"
  * Interesting reading this in hindsight
* Eradication of smallpox
  * Variolation
  * Cowpox
  * Disease control and surveillance important. Case-finding
  * Last case in Ethiopia in 1977
* Eradication of polio

## History of biological warfare and bioterrorism

* Hard to differentiate natural pandemics and biological attacks
* Lots of interesting historic examples of biowarfare here
* France and Germany in WW1
* Geneva protocol
* Unit 731 (Japan)
* US BW program
* BWC
* Iraq
* Non-state actors
  * Rajneesh cult ([Wild Wild Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Wild_Country))
  * Anthrax letters
  * Aum Shinrikyo
* Usefulness of attribution

## The Precipice

* Black death killed 1/4 - 1/2 of all Europeans in six years
* 1918 Flu killed 3-6% of the world's population
* Could civilization collapse as a result of a pandemic?
  * Regionally?
  * Globally?
* Fossil record argument: use the fact that we haven't been wiped out yet to infer that it can't be that likely
  * But this assumes that we're in a stationary regime, that things haven't changed
* Increasing propensity and vulnerability of the world to natural pandemics
  * Animal agriculture
  * Density and interconnectedness -- no separation
* On the other hand, better defended
  * Medicine
  * Hygiene and sanitation
  * Public health bodies
* Very difficult for a pandemic to reach all pockets of population
* Ord's view is that there is a low risk of extinction from natural pandemics
  * Seems supported to me -- evolution is not adversarial
* Rapid progress in biology
  * CRISPR
  * Gene drives
  * Exponentially falling genome sequencing cost
* Risks can be divided into well-intentioned mistakes and malicious actions
* Gain-of-function
  * Well-intentioned scientists creating more destructive pathogens
  * How well can do we contain things in labs? Biosafety
* Poor track record, even in BSL-4
* Malicious actions
  * State and non-state actors
* 15 countries developed bioweapons programs last century
  * Largest was Soviet
  * MAD
* Bioweapons small toll so far
  * Unreliable, backfire
  * Perhaps harder to develop than it first appears
  * Too little data, power law
* Change of regime for 21st Century
  * Democratisation leading to proliferation
* People with motivation to cause global destruction
  * Cults
  * Terrorists
  * Mental illness
  * Expanding circle of people with sufficient competency in biology, when will this overlap with the above?
* BWC
  * Underfunded: four employees
  * No effective means of verification of compliance
  * Soviets continued for 20 years after signing BWC
  * Not effective against non-state actors
* Efforts by synthesis companies to screen
* Efforts by science to better manage risks
* Information hazards
  * Science designed to spread information
  * Unilateralists curse
