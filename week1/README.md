## The Precipice

* Black death killed 1/4 - 1/2 of all Europeans in six years
* 1918 Flu killed 3-6% of the world's population
* Could civilization collapse as a result of a pandemic?
  * Regionally?
  * Globally?
* Fossil record argument: use the fact that we haven't been wiped out yet to infer that it can't be that likely
  * But this assumes that we're in a stationary regime, that things haven't changed
* Increasing propensity and vulnerability of the world to natural pandemics
  * Animal agriculture
  * Density and interconnectedness -- no separation
* On the other hand, better defended
  * Medicine
  * Hygiene and sanitation
  * Public health bodies
* Very difficult for a pandemic to reach all pockets of population
* Ord's view is that there is a low risk of extinction from natural pandemics
  * Seems supported to me -- evolution is not adversarial
* Rapid progress in biology
  * CRISPR
  * Gene drives
  * Exponentially falling genome sequencing cost
* Risks can be divided into well-intentioned mistakes and malicious actions
* Gain-of-function
  * Well-intentioned scientists creating more destructive pathogens
  * How well can do we contain things in labs? Biosafety
* Poor track record, even in BSL-4
* Malicious actions
  * State and non-state actors
* 15 countries developed bioweapons programs last century
  * Largest was Soviet
  * MAD
* Bioweapons small toll so far
  * Unreliable, backfire
  * Perhaps harder to develop than it first appears
  * Too little data, power law
* Change of regime for 21st Century
  * Democratisation leading to proliferation
* People with motivation to cause global destruction
  * Cults
  * Terrorists
  * Mental illness
  * Expanding circle of people with sufficient competency in biology, when will this overlap with the above?
* BWC
  * Underfunded: four employees
  * No effective means of verification of compliance
  * Soviets continued for 20 years after signing BWC
  * Not effective against non-state actors
* Efforts by synthesis companies to screen
* Efforts by science to better manage risks
* Information hazards
  * Science designed to spread information
  * Unilateralists curse
