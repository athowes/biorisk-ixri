# Biosecurity Reading Group (Imperial, Spring 2022)

## Background

The continuing COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates the enduring potential for biological risks to cause disaster.
Worryingly, these risks, and the scale of their consequences, may be growing over time as biotechnology progresses.
In this biosecurity reading group, over the spring term we will aim to get up to speed with the situation as it stands, before discussing how we might use our careers to mitigate these risks.

## Logistics

**If you're interested in taking part in this reading group, please register your interest [here](https://forms.gle/ktC2R5sxfqpUCr9VA) on the Google Form!**

The reading group will run for eight weeks (beginning w/c 24th January) and will be closely based upon the [EA Cambridge Biosecurity Seminar Program](https://www.eacambridge.org/biosecurity-programme).
We will meet each week for approximately an hour, to discuss a selection of core reading.
If possible, it will take place in person at either the South Kensington campus or St Mary's, Paddington depending on which location is convenient for the majority of participants.
Lunch will be provided (thank you to the [CEA](https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/) for funding!) if we're able to meet in person.

## About the organiser

Hi! I'm Adam, a third year PhD in the maths department working on models HIV surveillance.
I'm organising this reading group because I'd like to learn more about biosecurity, and reading groups are a good way to force yourself to actually learn something!
I'd particularly like to see if the disease surveillance skills I'm (hopefully) picking up during my PhD could somehow be applied to reducing the chance of there being a global catastrophic biological risk.
