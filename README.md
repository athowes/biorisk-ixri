# Biosecurity Reading Group (Imperial, Spring 2022)

## Background

The continuing COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates the enduring potential for biological risks to cause disaster.
Worryingly, these risks, and the scale of their consequences, may be growing over time as biotechnology progresses.
In this biosecurity reading group, over the spring term we will aim to get up to speed with the situation as it stands, before discussing how we might use our careers to mitigate these risks.

## Logistics

**If you're interested in taking part in this reading group, please register your interest [here](https://forms.gle/ktC2R5sxfqpUCr9VA) on the Google Form!**

The reading group will run for eight weeks (beginning w/c 24th January) and will be closely based upon the [EA Cambridge Biosecurity Seminar Program](https://www.eacambridge.org/biosecurity-seminar-programme) with some minor editing.
We will meet each week for approximately an hour, to discuss a selection of readings.
It will take place in person at St Mary's, Paddington (awaiting room and time allocation) and lunch will be provided (thank you to the [CEA](https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/) for funding!).

If you have any questions, feel free to get in touch with me via email at `ath19@ic.ac.uk`.

## Pandemics and bioweapons

Pandemics can roughly be divided into those occurring naturally and those which are synthetically engineered.
In this first session we will discuss the history of pandemics, as well as the ability of humanity to both respond to and create biological disasters.

The readings for this session are:

* [Emerging Infections: Microbial Threats to Health in the United States - Ledberg et al. (2008)](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/pdfs/lederburg-report-2008.pdf)
  * Section: "Background; Plague, Influenza, & Optimism and Indifference" (pages 16-26)
* [History of biological warfare and bioterrorism - Barras & Greub (2014)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X14641744)
  * Section: "Biological Warfare: A Classic Tool of Armies"
* [The Precipice - Toby Ord (2020)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NftXe80SXWThwRPDVc8Y04u5HTSHKzIg/view)
  * Section: "Pandemics" (Chapter 5: pages 124-138)

## About the organiser

Hi! I'm Adam, a third year PhD in the maths department working on HIV surveillance.
I'm organising this reading group because I'd like to learn more about biosecurity, and reading groups are a good way to force yourself to actually learn something!
I'd particularly like to see if the disease surveillance skills I'm (hopefully) picking up during my PhD could somehow be applied to reducing the chance of there being a global catastrophic biological disaster.
