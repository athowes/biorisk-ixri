# Apollo Program for Biodefense

* Detect and continually trace any new pathogen from the source
* Implement the National Blueprint for Biodefence

# 100 Days

* Pathogen Surveillance Report (Jeremy Farrar)
* DTVs (diagnostics, theraputics, vaccines)
* " we should create a market by using diagnostics as part of business-as-usual healthcare and surveillance. This will also improve care and help in the battle against antimicrobial resistance (AMR)."
* "Internationally-networked RCT platform"
* Embedding
preparation requires international financing for LMICs’ pandemic preparedness
and better oversight of global health threats,"

# JF report

* Metagenomics, artificial intelligence (AI) and associated technologies will support super network nodes in identifying trends and trigger more in depth analyses. As the super network develops, there will be considerable value in building and sharing databases to enable it to identify and track spatio-temporal changes in infectious disease features and where reservoirs of threat (e.g., antimicrobial resistance (AMR)) exist or develop and thereby identifying threats before they emerge. Over time this ‘archive of microbial life’ would also be an invaluable scientific resource useful for surveillance, epidemic control,
AMR monitoring and even climate change analysis.

* How to shorten timeline between novel pathogen identification, vaccine licensing and population-level coverage
* Pathogen-specific approach to finacing R&D fails to create adequate incentives to maximize pandemic preparedness
* Two approaches
  * Vaccine platforms
  * Prototype pathogens
* Platform based if an underlying nearly identical mechanism, device, delivery vector or cell line is employed for multiple target vaccines
* Prototype pathogen: do work for one pathogen and assume it will transfer
* Market failures for ID vaccines
  * Preventive products less economically lucrative than curative
  * Vaccine sales rarely a large share of revenues
* CEPI funded to coordinate funding for vaccines. Global equitable access
* Push and pull funding
* APC (Advance Purchase Commitment)
* COVAX
* If a vaccine is used to end epidemic early, how do we reward developers?
* Technological spillovers
* "Epidemiological, and economic modelling can be employed to estimate, at least to a first approximation, the optimal risk-adjusted rewards for successful development of vaccines against known emerging infectious diseases."
* Incentivise as to how to do things well rather than in a narrow way that just fulfills immediate objective
