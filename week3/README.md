# Risks and Benefits of GoF (CSER)

* Potential pandemic pathogen (PPP) rather than GOF
  * High virulence, pandemic potential, doesn't exists in nature
  * What about a two step model?
* Should any work on smallpox be done?
  * One in USA and one in Russia
* Mismatch between BSL required and risk
* Epistasis: a circumstance where the expression of one gene is affected by the expression of one or more independently inherited genes
  * Showing some skeptisism that science can understand
* Differences in calculations
  * Would want to go through this point by point
  * Base rate release versus special case release?
* Avian influenza
  * Influenza circulating in bird populations
  * Structure is interesting
  * Have been evolving in nature
  * Genomes are cut up into chunks: 8 segments, highly modular, switch segments and parts of segments
  * Jump to pigs
  * Naturally occurring outbreaks of influenza H5N1

* No country has ever developed nuclear weapons while being a party to the NPT
  * But the BWC isn't as successful
* Unit 731 trying to disguise as natural pandemic
  * Importance of attribution https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19612-0
* Pinker making seemly overconfident claims "not damage but theater"
  * Tail events
* What is the full spectrum of microbes that cause human disease?
  * And which types of microbes would most likely be used as bioweapons? 
* BWC incorporate newer advances (again)
* Give the BWC’s Implementation Support Unit more resources
  * Four people
  * 5% what is allocated to CWC
* "adequately screening all synthesized DNA could eliminate the most serious foreseeable hazards of biotech misuse by nonstate actors.”
* "availability of reliable diagnostic assays that can quickly and accurately determine infection status.”

# Rootclaim

* One seed event versus multiple
  * Difficulty of studying any epidemic or pandemic
